## Mental notes to avoid brain imploding:

- Wardrobe Appearance, Trigger Alias's Pattern and Trigger data will still
be stored locally.

- This information would cause database bloat, and is not necessary to see while
offline.

- Instead, this information will be stored in a locally accessed client set 
characterData file, which is saved to config.

- This file will know which user it is associated with by defining the respective UID in storage

- This config save will work similarly to the way that the client saves server labels/tags,
and server nicknames, and configurations
